# Photo Gallery Application in Java

This single-user Photo Gallery Application was coded in April 2024 for the course Software Methodology. It allows the storage and management of photos in one or more albums. All user interactions were implemented in Java FX, and all UIs were designed in FXML. 

Some of the features of this application include:
- An admin subsystem which allows the admin to create/delete users and view all users
- The non-admin subsystem which allows users to login and view all albums and photo information for this user from a previous session
- A user can then create/delete/rename photo albums, open an album which displays all photos, and search for photos
- After opening an album, the user can add/remove photos, caption/recaption photos, display the photo, add/delete tags from photos, or copy a photo to a different album
- The search function allows the user to search by date range and tag-value pairs
