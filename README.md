Photo Album Application

A fully functional photo album application for unique users coded in Java, Java FX, and FXML for CS213, Spring 2024.

This project utilizes the Java Serializable package to create and save unique user data of photo albums. 
Unique users can be created via the "admin" user, and each user is preloaded with an example stock album containing default photos.
Users can then create their own albums and add/remove photos, as well as customize photos by adding tags (name:value pairs such as "location : New York") and captions.
Uploading photos to the software will serialize the image's path within the local machine so data is saved after every session.

Note that for the grader, the HTML documents were initially uploaded into the repository. However, when the project was zipped, the zipped file was unable to be downloaded or opened due to a "virus detected."
We tried many solutions, such as generating the documents in a different manner, but we utimately were unable to create a version in which the zipped file would successfully download. Thus, they were omitted.
